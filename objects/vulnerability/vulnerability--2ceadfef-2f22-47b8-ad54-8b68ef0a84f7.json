            "description": "\nA heap-based memory buffer overflow vulnerability in Rockwell Automation Arena Simulation software could potentially allow a malicious user to insert unauthorized code into the software by overstepping the memory boundaries, which triggers an access violation.  Once inside, the threat actor can run harmful code on the system. This affects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the product. To trigger this, the user would unwittingly need to open a malicious file shared by the threat actor.\n\n",
