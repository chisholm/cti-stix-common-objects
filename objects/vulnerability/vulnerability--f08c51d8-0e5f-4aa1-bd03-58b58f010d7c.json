            "description": "Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance edge/middle/service proxy. Prior to 1.33.1, 1.32.4, 1.31.6, and 1.30.10, Envoy's ext_proc HTTP filter is at risk of crashing if a local reply is sent to the external server due to the filter's life time issue. A known situation is the failure of a websocket handshake will trigger a local reply leading to the crash of Envoy. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.33.1, 1.32.4, 1.31.6, and 1.30.10.",
