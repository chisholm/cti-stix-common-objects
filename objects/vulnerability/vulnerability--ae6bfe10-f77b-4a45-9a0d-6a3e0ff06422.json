            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmfd: intel_soc_pmic_bxtwc: Use IRQ domain for USB Type-C device\n\nWhile design wise the idea of converting the driver to use\nthe hierarchy of the IRQ chips is correct, the implementation\nhas (inherited) flaws. This was unveiled when platform_get_irq()\nhad started WARN() on IRQ 0 that is supposed to be a Linux\nIRQ number (also known as vIRQ).\n\nRework the driver to respect IRQ domain when creating each MFD\ndevice separately, as the domain is not the same for all of them.",
