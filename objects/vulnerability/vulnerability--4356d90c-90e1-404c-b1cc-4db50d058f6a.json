            "description": "The Colibri Page Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.253. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the apiCall() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to call a limited set of functions that can be used to import images, delete posts, or save theme data via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
