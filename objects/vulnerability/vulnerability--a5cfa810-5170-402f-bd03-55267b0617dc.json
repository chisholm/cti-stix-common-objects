            "description": "Suricata is a network Intrusion Detection System, Intrusion Prevention System and Network Security Monitoring engine. Prior to 7.0.5 and 6.0.19, a small amount of HTTP/2 traffic can lead to Suricata using a large amount of memory. The issue has been addressed in Suricata 7.0.5 and 6.0.19. Workarounds include disabling the HTTP/2 parser and reducing `app-layer.protocols.http2.max-table-size` value (default is 65536).",
