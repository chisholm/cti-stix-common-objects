This issue affects some unknown processing of the file member_register.php. The manipulation of the argument fullname/username/password/email leads to sql injection. The attack may be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The initial researcher advisory only mentions the parameter \"password\" to be affected. But it must be assumed that other parameters are affected as well.",
