            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsch_cake: Fix out of bounds when parsing TCP options and header\n\nThe TCP option parser in cake qdisc (cake_get_tcpopt and\ncake_tcph_may_drop) could read one byte out of bounds. When the length\nis 1, the execution flow gets into the loop, reads one byte of the\nopcode, and if the opcode is neither TCPOPT_EOL nor TCPOPT_NOP, it reads\none more byte, which exceeds the length of 1.\n\nThis fix is inspired by commit 9609dad263f8 (\"ipv4: tcp_input: fix stack\nout of bounds when parsing TCP options.\").\n\nv2 changes:\n\nAdded doff validation in cake_get_tcphdr to avoid parsing garbage as TCP\nheader. Although it wasn't strictly an out-of-bounds access (memory was\nallocated), garbage values could be read where CAKE expected the TCP\nheader if doff was smaller than 5.",
