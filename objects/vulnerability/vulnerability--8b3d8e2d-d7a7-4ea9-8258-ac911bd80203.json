            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnvme: fix reconnection fail due to reserved tag allocation\n\nWe found a issue on production environment while using NVMe over RDMA,\nadmin_q reconnect failed forever while remote target and network is ok.\nAfter dig into it, we found it may caused by a ABBA deadlock due to tag\nallocation. In my case, the tag was hold by a keep alive request\nwaiting inside admin_q, as we quiesced admin_q while reset ctrl, so the\nrequest maked as idle and will not process before reset success. As\nfabric_q shares tagset with admin_q, while reconnect remote target, we\nneed a tag for connect command, but the only one reserved tag was held\nby keep alive command which waiting inside admin_q. As a result, we\nfailed to reconnect admin_q forever. In order to fix this issue, I\nthink we should keep two reserved tags for admin queue.",
