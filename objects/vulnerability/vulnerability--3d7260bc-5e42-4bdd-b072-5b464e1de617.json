            "description": "An improper access control vulnerability exists in the gaizhenbiao/chuanhuchatgpt application, specifically in version 20240410. This vulnerability allows any user on the server to access the chat history of any other user without requiring any form of interaction between the users. Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to data breaches, including the exposure of sensitive personal details, financial data, or confidential conversations. Additionally, it could facilitate identity theft and manipulation or fraud through the unauthorized access to users' chat histories. This issue is due to insufficient access control mechanisms in the application's handling of chat history data.",
