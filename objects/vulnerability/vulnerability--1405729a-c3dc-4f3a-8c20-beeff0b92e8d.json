            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nRevert \"mmc: dw_mmc: Fix IDMAC operation with pages bigger than 4K\"\n\nThe commit 8396c793ffdf (\"mmc: dw_mmc: Fix IDMAC operation with pages\nbigger than 4K\") increased the max_req_size, even for 4K pages, causing\nvarious issues:\n- Panic booting the kernel/rootfs from an SD card on Rockchip RK3566\n- Panic booting the kernel/rootfs from an SD card on StarFive JH7100\n- \"swiotlb buffer is full\" and data corruption on StarFive JH7110\n\nAt this stage no fix have been found, so it's probably better to just\nrevert the change.\n\nThis reverts commit 8396c793ffdf28bb8aee7cfe0891080f8cab7890.",
