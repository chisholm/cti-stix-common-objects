            "description": "The User Registration & Membership â€“ Custom Registration Form, Login Form, and User Profile plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 4.2.1 via the create_stripe_subscription() function, due to missing validation on the 'member_id' user controlled key. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary user accounts that have registered through the plugin.",
