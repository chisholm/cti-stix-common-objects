            "description": "An issue was discovered on G-Net Dashcam BB GONX devices. A Public Domain name is Used for the Internal Domain Name. It uses an unregistered public domain name as an internal domain, creating a security risk. This domain was not owned by GNET originally, allowing an attacker to register it and potentially intercept sensitive device traffic (it has since been registered by the vulnerability discoverer). If the dashcam or related services attempt to resolve this domain over the public Internet instead of locally, it could lead to data exfiltration or man-in-the-middle attacks.",
