            "description": "Shields.io is a service for concise, consistent, and legible badges in SVG and raster format. Shields.io and users self-hosting their own instance of shields using version < `server-2024-09-25` are vulnerable to a remote execution vulnerability via the JSONPath library used by the Dynamic JSON/Toml/Yaml badges. This vulnerability would allow any user with access to make a request to a URL on the instance to the ability to execute code by crafting a malicious JSONPath expression. All users who self-host an instance are vulnerable. This problem was fixed in server-2024-09-25. Those who follow the tagged releases should update to `server-2024-09-25` or later. Those who follow the rolling tag on DockerHub, `docker pull shieldsio/shields:next` to update to the latest version. As a workaround, blocking access to the endpoints `/badge/dynamic/json`, `/badge/dynamic/toml`, and `/badge/dynamic/yaml` (e.g: via a firewall or reverse proxy in front of your instance) would prevent the exploitable endpoints from being accessed.",
