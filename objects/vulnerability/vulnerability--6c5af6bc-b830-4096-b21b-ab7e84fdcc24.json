            "description": "The The CURCY – Multi Currency for WooCommerce – The best free currency exchange plugin – Run smoothly on WooCommerce 9.x plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution via the get_products_price() function in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.5. This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes.",
