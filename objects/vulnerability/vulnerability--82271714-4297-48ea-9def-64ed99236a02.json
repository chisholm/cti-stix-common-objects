            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnilfs2: fix nilfs_empty_dir() misjudgment and long loop on I/O errors\n\nThe error handling in nilfs_empty_dir() when a directory folio/page read\nfails is incorrect, as in the old ext2 implementation, and if the\nfolio/page cannot be read or nilfs_check_folio() fails, it will falsely\ndetermine the directory as empty and corrupt the file system.\n\nIn addition, since nilfs_empty_dir() does not immediately return on a\nfailed folio/page read, but continues to loop, this can cause a long loop\nwith I/O if i_size of the directory's inode is also corrupted, causing the\nlog writer thread to wait and hang, as reported by syzbot.\n\nFix these issues by making nilfs_empty_dir() immediately return a false\nvalue (0) if it fails to get a directory folio/page.",
