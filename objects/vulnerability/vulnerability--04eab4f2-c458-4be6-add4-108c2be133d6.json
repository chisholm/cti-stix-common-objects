            "description": "Adobe Experience Manager versions 6.5.21 and earlier are affected by a DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability that could be exploited to execute arbitrary code in the context of the victim's browser session. By manipulating the DOM environment in the victim's browser, a low privileged attacker can inject malicious scripts that are executed by the victim's browser. Exploitation of this issue requires user interaction, typically in the form of following a malicious link.",
