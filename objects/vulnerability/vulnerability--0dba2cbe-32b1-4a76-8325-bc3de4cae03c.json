            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/v3d: Stop active perfmon if it is being destroyed\n\nIf the active performance monitor (`v3d->active_perfmon`) is being\ndestroyed, stop it first. Currently, the active perfmon is not\nstopped during destruction, leaving the `v3d->active_perfmon` pointer\nstale. This can lead to undefined behavior and instability.\n\nThis patch ensures that the active perfmon is stopped before being\ndestroyed, aligning with the behavior introduced in commit\n7d1fd3638ee3 (\"drm/v3d: Stop the active perfmon before being destroyed\").",
