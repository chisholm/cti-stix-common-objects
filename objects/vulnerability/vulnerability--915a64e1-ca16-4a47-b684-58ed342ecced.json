            "description": "A vulnerability has been identified in the port ACL functionality of AOS-CX software running on the HPE Aruba Networking CX 9300 Switch Series only and affects: \n\n     - AOS-CX 10.14.xxxx : All patches\n     - AOS-CX 10.15.xxxx : 10.15.1000 and below \nThe vulnerability is specific to traffic originated by the CX 9300 switch platform and could allow an attacker to bypass ACL rules applied to routed ports on egress. As a result, port ACLs are not correctly enforced, which could lead to unauthorized traffic flow and violations of security policies. Egress VLAN ACLs and Routed VLAN ACLs are not affected by this vulnerability.",
