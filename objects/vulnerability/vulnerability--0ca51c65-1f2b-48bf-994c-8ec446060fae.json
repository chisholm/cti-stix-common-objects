            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nexfat: fix missing shutdown check\n\nxfstests generic/730 test failed because after deleting the device\nthat still had dirty data, the file could still be read without\nreturning an error. The reason is the missing shutdown check in\n->read_iter.\n\nI also noticed that shutdown checks were missing from ->write_iter,\n->splice_read, and ->mmap. This commit adds shutdown checks to all\nof them.",
