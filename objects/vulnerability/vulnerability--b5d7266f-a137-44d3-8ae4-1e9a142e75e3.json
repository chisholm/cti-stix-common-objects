            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfat: fix uninitialized field in nostale filehandles\n\nWhen fat_encode_fh_nostale() encodes file handle without a parent it\nstores only first 10 bytes of the file handle. However the length of the\nfile handle must be a multiple of 4 so the file handle is actually 12\nbytes long and the last two bytes remain uninitialized. This is not\ngreat at we potentially leak uninitialized information with the handle\nto userspace. Properly initialize the full handle length.",
