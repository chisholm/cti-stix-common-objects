            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nixgbe: Fix NULL pointer dereference in ethtool loopback test\n\nThe ixgbe driver currently generates a NULL pointer dereference when\nperforming the ethtool loopback test. This is due to the fact that there\nisn't a q_vector associated with the test ring when it is setup as\ninterrupts are not normally added to the test rings.\n\nTo address this I have added code that will check for a q_vector before\nreturning a napi_id value. If a q_vector is not present it will return a\nvalue of 0.",
