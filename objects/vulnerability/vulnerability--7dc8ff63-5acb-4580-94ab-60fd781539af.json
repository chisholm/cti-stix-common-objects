            "description": "Logsign Unified SecOps Platform Directory Traversal Arbitrary Directory Deletion Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to delete arbitrary directories on affected installations of Logsign Unified SecOps Platform. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the HTTP API service, which listens on TCP port 443 by default. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path prior to using it in file operations. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to delete directories in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-25028.",
