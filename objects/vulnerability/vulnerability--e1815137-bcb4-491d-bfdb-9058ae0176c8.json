            "description": "A vulnerability in ollama/ollama version 0.1.37 allows for remote code execution (RCE) due to improper input validation in the handling of zip files. The vulnerability, known as ZipSlip, occurs in the parseFromZipFile function in server/model.go. The code does not check for directory traversal sequences (../) in file names within the zip archive, allowing an attacker to write arbitrary files to the file system. This can be exploited to create files such as /etc/ld.so.preload and a malicious shared library, leading to RCE.",
