            "description": "In SAP NetWeaver Java (Software Update Manager 1.1), under certain conditions when a software upgrade encounters errors, credentials are written in plaintext to a log file. An attacker with local access to the server, authenticated as a non-administrative user, can acquire the credentials from the logs. This leads to a high impact on confidentiality, with no impact on integrity or availability.",
