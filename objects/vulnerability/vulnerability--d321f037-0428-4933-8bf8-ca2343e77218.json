            "description": "Heap-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability in Apache ORC.\n\nA vulnerability has been identified in the ORC C++ LZO decompression logic, where specially crafted malformed ORC files can cause the decompressor toÂ allocate a 250-byte buffer but then attempts to copy 295 bytes into it. It causes memory corruption.\n\nThis issue affects Apache ORC C++ library: through 1.8.8, from 1.9.0 through 1.9.5, from 2.0.0 through 2.0.4, from 2.1.0 through 2.1.1.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 1.8.9, 1.9.6, 2.0.5, and 2.1.2, which fix the issue.",
