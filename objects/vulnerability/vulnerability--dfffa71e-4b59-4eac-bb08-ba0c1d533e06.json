            "description": "GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. An uninitialized stack variable vulnerability has been identified in the gst_matroska_demux_add_wvpk_header function within matroska-demux.c. When size < 4, the program calls gst_buffer_unmap with an uninitialized map variable. Then, in the gst_memory_unmap function, the program will attempt to unmap the buffer using the uninitialized map variable, causing a function pointer hijack, as it will jump to mem->allocator->mem_unmap_full or mem->allocator->mem_unmap. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to hijack the execution flow, potentially leading to code execution. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.",
