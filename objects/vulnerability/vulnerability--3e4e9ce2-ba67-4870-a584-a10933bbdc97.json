            "description": "The Digits plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 8.4.1. This is due to missing nonce validation in the 'digits_save_settings' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the default role of registered users to elevate user privileges via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
