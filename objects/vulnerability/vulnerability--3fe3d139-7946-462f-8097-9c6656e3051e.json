            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfs/proc/task_mmu: move mmu notification mechanism inside mm lock\n\nMove mmu notification mechanism inside mm lock to prevent race condition\nin other components which depend on it.  The notifier will invalidate\nmemory range.  Depending upon the number of iterations, different memory\nranges would be invalidated.\n\nThe following warning would be removed by this patch:\nWARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 5067 at arch/x86/kvm/../../../virt/kvm/kvm_main.c:734 kvm_mmu_notifier_change_pte+0x860/0x960 arch/x86/kvm/../../../virt/kvm/kvm_main.c:734\n\nThere is no behavioural and performance change with this patch when\nthere is no component registered with the mmu notifier.\n\n[akpm@linux-foundation.org: narrow the scope of `range', per Sean]",
