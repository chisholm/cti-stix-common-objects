            "description": "The Beaver Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the Icon Widget 'fl_builder_data[node_preview][link]' and 'fl_builder_data[settings][link_target]' parameters in all versions up to, and including, 2.7.4.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
