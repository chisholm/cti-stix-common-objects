            "description": "Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion-WebUI is a voice changing framework based on VITS. Versions 2.2.231006 and prior are vulnerable to unsafe deserialization. The model_choose variable takes user input (e.g. a path to a model) and passes it to the uvr function in vr.py. In uvr , if model_name contains the string \"DeEcho\", a new instance of AudioPreDeEcho class is created with the model_path attribute containing the aforementioned user input. In the AudioPreDeEcho class, the user input is used to load the model on that path with torch.load, which can lead to unsafe deserialization and remote code execution. As of time of publication, no known patches exist.",
