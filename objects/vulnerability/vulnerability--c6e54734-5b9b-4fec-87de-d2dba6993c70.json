            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: ethernet: stmmac: fix altr_tse_pcs function when using a fixed-link\n\nWhen using a fixed-link, the altr_tse_pcs driver crashes\ndue to null-pointer dereference as no phy_device is provided to\ntse_pcs_fix_mac_speed function. Fix this by adding a check for\nphy_dev before calling the tse_pcs_fix_mac_speed() function.\n\nAlso clean up the tse_pcs_fix_mac_speed function a bit. There is\nno need to check for splitter_base and sgmii_adapter_base\nbecause the driver will fail if these 2 variables are not\nderived from the device tree.",
