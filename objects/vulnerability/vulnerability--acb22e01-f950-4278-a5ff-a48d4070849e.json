            "description": "Incorrect Access Control in the Preview Function of Gleamtech FileVista 9.2.0.0 allows remote attackers to gain unauthorized access via exploiting a vulnerability in access control mechanisms by removing authentication-related HTTP headers, such as the Cookie header, in the request. This bypasses the authentication process and grants attackers access to sensitive image files without proper login credentials.",
