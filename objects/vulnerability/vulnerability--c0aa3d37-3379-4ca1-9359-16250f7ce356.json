            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/mlx5e: SHAMPO, Fix invalid WQ linked list unlink\n\nWhen all the strides in a WQE have been consumed, the WQE is unlinked\nfrom the WQ linked list (mlx5_wq_ll_pop()). For SHAMPO, it is possible\nto receive CQEs with 0 consumed strides for the same WQE even after the\nWQE is fully consumed and unlinked. This triggers an additional unlink\nfor the same wqe which corrupts the linked list.\n\nFix this scenario by accepting 0 sized consumed strides without\nunlinking the WQE again.",
