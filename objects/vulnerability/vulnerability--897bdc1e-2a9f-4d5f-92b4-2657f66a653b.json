            "description": "The WPGlobus Translate Options plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the on__translate_options_page() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious web scripts and update plugin settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
