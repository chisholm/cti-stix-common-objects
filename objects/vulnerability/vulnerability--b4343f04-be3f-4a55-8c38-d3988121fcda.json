            "description": "The Easy PayPal Gift Certificate plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.2.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'wpppgc_plugin_options' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the plugin's settings and inject malicious JavaScript via a forged request, granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
