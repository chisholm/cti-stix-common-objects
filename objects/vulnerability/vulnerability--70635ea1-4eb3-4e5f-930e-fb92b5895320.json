            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nriscv, bpf: Fix out-of-bounds issue when preparing trampoline image\n\nWe get the size of the trampoline image during the dry run phase and\nallocate memory based on that size. The allocated image will then be\npopulated with instructions during the real patch phase. But after\ncommit 26ef208c209a (\"bpf: Use arch_bpf_trampoline_size\"), the `im`\nargument is inconsistent in the dry run and real patch phase. This may\ncause emit_imm in RV64 to generate a different number of instructions\nwhen generating the 'im' address, potentially causing out-of-bounds\nissues. Let's emit the maximum number of instructions for the \"im\"\naddress during dry run to fix this problem.",
