This may lead to a division by zero when DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST()\nis called within ad7124_set_channel_odr(). The ad7124_write_raw()\nfunction is invoked through the sequence: iio_write_channel_raw() ->\niio_write_channel_attribute() -> iio_channel_write(), with no checks\nin place to ensure val is non-zero.",
