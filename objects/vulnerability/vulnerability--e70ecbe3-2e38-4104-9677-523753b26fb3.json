The vulnerability is present in the dataset deletion functionality, where the application fails to verify if the user requesting the deletion has the appropriate permissions. This allows unauthorized users to send a DELETE request to the server and delete any dataset by specifying its ID. The issue is located in the datasets.delete function within the datasets index file.",
