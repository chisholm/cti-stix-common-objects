            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: clean up our handling of refs == 0 in snapshot delete\n\nIn reada we BUG_ON(refs == 0), which could be unkind since we aren't\nholding a lock on the extent leaf and thus could get a transient\nincorrect answer.  In walk_down_proc we also BUG_ON(refs == 0), which\ncould happen if we have extent tree corruption.  Change that to return\n-EUCLEAN.  In do_walk_down() we catch this case and handle it correctly,\nhowever we return -EIO, which -EUCLEAN is a more appropriate error code.\nFinally in walk_up_proc we have the same BUG_ON(refs == 0), so convert\nthat to proper error handling.  Also adjust the error message so we can\nactually do something with the information.",
