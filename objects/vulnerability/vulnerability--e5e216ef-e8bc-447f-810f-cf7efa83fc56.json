            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: fix __dst_negative_advice() race\n\n__dst_negative_advice() does not enforce proper RCU rules when\nsk->dst_cache must be cleared, leading to possible UAF.\n\nRCU rules are that we must first clear sk->sk_dst_cache,\nthen call dst_release(old_dst).\n\nNote that sk_dst_reset(sk) is implementing this protocol correctly,\nwhile __dst_negative_advice() uses the wrong order.\n\nGiven that ip6_negative_advice() has special logic\nagainst RTF_CACHE, this means each of the three ->negative_advice()\nexisting methods must perform the sk_dst_reset() themselves.\n\nNote the check against NULL dst is centralized in\n__dst_negative_advice(), there is no need to duplicate\nit in various callbacks.\n\nMany thanks to Clement Lecigne for tracking this issue.\n\nThis old bug became visible after the blamed commit, using UDP sockets.",
