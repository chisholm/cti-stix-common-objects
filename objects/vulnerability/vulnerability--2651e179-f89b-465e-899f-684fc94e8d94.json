            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: streamzap: fix race between device disconnection and urb callback\n\nSyzkaller has reported a general protection fault at function\nir_raw_event_store_with_filter(). This crash is caused by a NULL pointer\ndereference of dev->raw pointer, even though it is checked for NULL in\nthe same function, which means there is a race condition. It occurs due\nto the incorrect order of actions in the streamzap_disconnect() function:\nrc_unregister_device() is called before usb_kill_urb(). The dev->raw\npointer is freed and set to NULL in rc_unregister_device(), and only\nafter that usb_kill_urb() waits for in-progress requests to finish.\n\nIf rc_unregister_device() is called while streamzap_callback() handler is\nnot finished, this can lead to accessing freed resources. Thus\nrc_unregister_device() should be called after usb_kill_urb().\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with Syzkaller.",
