            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmcb: fix error handling in mcb_alloc_bus()\n\nThere are two bugs:\n1) If ida_simple_get() fails then this code calls put_device(carrier)\n   but we haven't yet called get_device(carrier) and probably that\n   leads to a use after free.\n2) After device_initialize() then we need to use put_device() to\n   release the bus.  This will free the internal resources tied to the\n   device and call mcb_free_bus() which will free the rest.",
