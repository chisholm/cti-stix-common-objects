            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/nouveau: Fix WARN_ON in nouveau_fence_context_kill()\n\nNouveau is mostly designed in a way that it's expected that fences only\never get signaled through nouveau_fence_signal(). However, in at least\none other place, nouveau_fence_done(), can signal fences, too. If that\nhappens (race) a signaled fence remains in the pending list for a while,\nuntil it gets removed by nouveau_fence_update().\n\nShould nouveau_fence_context_kill() run in the meantime, this would be\na bug because the function would attempt to set an error code on an\nalready signaled fence.\n\nHave nouveau_fence_context_kill() check for a fence being signaled.",
