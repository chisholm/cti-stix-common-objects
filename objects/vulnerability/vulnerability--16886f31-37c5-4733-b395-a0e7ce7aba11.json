            "description": "The file names constructed within image_picker are missing sanitization checks leaving them vulnerable to malicious document providers. This may result in cases where a user with a malicious document provider installed can select an image file from that provider while using your app and could potentially override internal files in your app cache. Issue patched in 0.8.12+18. It is recommended to update to the latest version of image_picker_android that contains the changes to address this vulnerability.",
