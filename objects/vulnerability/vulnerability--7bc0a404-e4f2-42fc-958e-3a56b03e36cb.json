            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nserial: 8250: omap: Don't skip resource freeing if pm_runtime_resume_and_get() failed\n\nReturning an error code from .remove() makes the driver core emit the\nlittle helpful error message:\n\n\tremove callback returned a non-zero value. This will be ignored.\n\nand then remove the device anyhow. So all resources that were not freed\nare leaked in this case. Skipping serial8250_unregister_port() has the\npotential to keep enough of the UART around to trigger a use-after-free.\n\nSo replace the error return (and with it the little helpful error\nmessage) by a more useful error message and continue to cleanup.",
