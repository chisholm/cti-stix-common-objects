            "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack and execute commands on the CLI of an affected device.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading an already authenticated user to follow a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions on the affected device with the privileges of the targeted user.",
