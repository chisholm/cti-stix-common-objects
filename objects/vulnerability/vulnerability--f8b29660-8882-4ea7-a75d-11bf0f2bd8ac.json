            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnouveau/dmem: handle kcalloc() allocation failure\n\nThe kcalloc() in nouveau_dmem_evict_chunk() will return null if\nthe physical memory has run out. As a result, if we dereference\nsrc_pfns, dst_pfns or dma_addrs, the null pointer dereference bugs\nwill happen.\n\nMoreover, the GPU is going away. If the kcalloc() fails, we could not\nevict all pages mapping a chunk. So this patch adds a __GFP_NOFAIL\nflag in kcalloc().\n\nFinally, as there is no need to have physically contiguous memory,\nthis patch switches kcalloc() to kvcalloc() in order to avoid\nfailing allocations.",
