            "description": "In function pci1xxxx_spi_probe, there is a potential null pointer that\nmay be caused by a failed memory allocation by the function devm_kzalloc.\nHence, a null pointer check needs to be added to prevent null pointer\ndereferencing later in the code.\n\nTo fix this issue, spi_bus->spi_int[iter] should be checked. The memory\nallocated by devm_kzalloc will be automatically released, so just directly\nreturn -ENOMEM without worrying about memory leaks.\n\n",
