            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/xe: Use local fence in error path of xe_migrate_clear\n\nThe intent of the error path in xe_migrate_clear is to wait on locally\ngenerated fence and then return. The code is waiting on m->fence which\ncould be the local fence but this is only stable under the job mutex\nleading to a possible UAF. Fix code to wait on local fence.\n\n(cherry picked from commit 762b7e95362170b3e13a8704f38d5e47eca4ba74)",
