            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: lpfc: Revise lpfc_prep_embed_io routine with proper endian macro usages\n\nOn big endian architectures, it is possible to run into a memory out of\nbounds pointer dereference when FCP targets are zoned.\n\nIn lpfc_prep_embed_io, the memcpy(ptr, fcp_cmnd, sgl->sge_len) is\nreferencing a little endian formatted sgl->sge_len value.  So, the memcpy\ncan cause big endian systems to crash.\n\nRedefine the *sgl ptr as a struct sli4_sge_le to make it clear that we are\nreferring to a little endian formatted data structure.  And, update the\nroutine with proper le32_to_cpu macro usages.",
