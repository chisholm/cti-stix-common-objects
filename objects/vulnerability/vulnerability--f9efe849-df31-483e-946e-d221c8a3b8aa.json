            "description": "The Guten Post Layout – An Advanced Post Grid Collection for WordPress Gutenberg plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘align’ attribute within the 'wp:guten-post-layout/post-grid' Gutenberg block in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
