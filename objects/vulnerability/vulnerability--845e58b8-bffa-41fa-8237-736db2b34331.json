            "description": "A buffer overflow flaw was found in X.Org and Xwayland. If XkbChangeTypesOfKey() is called with a 0 group, it will resize the key symbols table to 0 but leave the key actions unchanged. If the same function is later called with a non-zero value of groups, this will cause a buffer overflow because the key actions are of the wrong size.",
