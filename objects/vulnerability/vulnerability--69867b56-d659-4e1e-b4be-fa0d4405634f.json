Affected by this issue is some unknown functionality of the component JWT Token Handler. The manipulation leads to use of default cryptographic key. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation is known to be difficult. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way. Instead the issue posted on GitHub got deleted without any explanation.",
