            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npowerpc/pseries: Enforce hcall result buffer validity and size\n\nplpar_hcall(), plpar_hcall9(), and related functions expect callers to\nprovide valid result buffers of certain minimum size. Currently this\nis communicated only through comments in the code and the compiler has\nno idea.\n\nFor example, if I write a bug like this:\n\n  long retbuf[PLPAR_HCALL_BUFSIZE]; // should be PLPAR_HCALL9_BUFSIZE\n  plpar_hcall9(H_ALLOCATE_VAS_WINDOW, retbuf, ...);\n\nThis compiles with no diagnostics emitted, but likely results in stack\ncorruption at runtime when plpar_hcall9() stores results past the end\nof the array. (To be clear this is a contrived example and I have not\nfound a real instance yet.)\n\nTo make this class of error less likely, we can use explicitly-sized\narray parameters instead of pointers in the declarations for the hcall\nAPIs. When compiled with -Warray-bounds[1], the code above now\nprovokes a diagnostic like this:\n\nerror: array argument is too small;\nis of size 32, callee requires at least 72 [-Werror,-Warray-bounds]\n   60 |                 plpar_hcall9(H_ALLOCATE_VAS_WINDOW, retbuf,\n      |                 ^                                   ~~~~~~\n\n[1] Enabled for LLVM builds but not GCC for now. See commit\n    0da6e5fd6c37 (\"gcc: disable '-Warray-bounds' for gcc-13 too\") and\n    related changes.",
