            "description": "In h2oai/h2o-3 version 3.46.0, the endpoint for exporting models does not restrict the export location, allowing an attacker to export a model to any file in the server's file structure, thereby overwriting it. This vulnerability can be exploited to overwrite any file on the target server with a trained model file, although the content of the overwrite is not controllable by the attacker.",
