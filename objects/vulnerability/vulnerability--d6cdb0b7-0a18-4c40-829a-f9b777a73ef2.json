            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nblock: add check that partition length needs to be aligned with block size\n\nBefore calling add partition or resize partition, there is no check\non whether the length is aligned with the logical block size.\nIf the logical block size of the disk is larger than 512 bytes,\nthen the partition size maybe not the multiple of the logical block size,\nand when the last sector is read, bio_truncate() will adjust the bio size,\nresulting in an IO error if the size of the read command is smaller than\nthe logical block size.If integrity data is supported, this will also\nresult in a null pointer dereference when calling bio_integrity_free.",
