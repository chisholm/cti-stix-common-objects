            "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Alpine Halo9 devices. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the DLT interface, which listens on TCP port 3490 by default. The issue results from the lack of authentication prior to allowing access to functionality. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the device.",
