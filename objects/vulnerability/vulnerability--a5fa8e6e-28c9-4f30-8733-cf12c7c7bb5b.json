            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nPCI: vmd: Make vmd_dev::cfg_lock a raw_spinlock_t type\n\nThe access to the PCI config space via pci_ops::read and pci_ops::write is\na low-level hardware access. The functions can be accessed with disabled\ninterrupts even on PREEMPT_RT. The pci_lock is a raw_spinlock_t for this\npurpose.\n\nA spinlock_t becomes a sleeping lock on PREEMPT_RT, so it cannot be\nacquired with disabled interrupts. The vmd_dev::cfg_lock is accessed in\nthe same context as the pci_lock.\n\nMake vmd_dev::cfg_lock a raw_spinlock_t type so it can be used with\ninterrupts disabled.\n\nThis was reported as:\n\n  BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at kernel/locking/spinlock_rt.c:48\n  Call Trace:\n   rt_spin_lock+0x4e/0x130\n   vmd_pci_read+0x8d/0x100 [vmd]\n   pci_user_read_config_byte+0x6f/0xe0\n   pci_read_config+0xfe/0x290\n   sysfs_kf_bin_read+0x68/0x90\n\n[bigeasy: reword commit message]\nTested-off-by: Luis Claudio R.
