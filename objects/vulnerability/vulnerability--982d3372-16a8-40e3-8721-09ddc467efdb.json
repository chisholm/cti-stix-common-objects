            "description": "A vulnerability in the application data endpoints of Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager, formerly Cisco SD-WAN vManage, could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to write arbitrary files to an affected system.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper validation of requests to APIs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious requests to an API within the affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to conduct directory traversal attacks and write files to an arbitrary location on the affected system.",
