            "description": "Tesla Model S Iris Modem QCMAP_ConnectionManager Improper Input Validation Sandbox Escape Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows local attackers to escape the sandbox on affected affected Tesla Model S vehicles. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the QCMAP_ConnectionManager component. An attacker can abuse the service to assign LAN addresses to the WWAN. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to access network services that were only intended to be exposed to the internal LAN. Was ZDI-CAN-23199.",
