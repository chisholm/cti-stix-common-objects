            "description": "A vulnerability has been found in Wing FTP Server up to 7.4.3 and classified as critical. Affected by this vulnerability is an unknown functionality of the component Lua Admin Console. The manipulation leads to execution with unnecessary privileges. The attack can be launched remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation appears to be difficult. Upgrading to version 7.4.4 is able to address this issue. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component. The vendor explains: \"[W]e do not consider it as a security vulnerability, because the system admin in WingFTP has full permissions [...], but you can suggest the user run WingFTP service as Normal User rather than SYSTEM/Root, it will be safer.\"",
