            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nipv6: sr: fix missing sk_buff release in seg6_input_core\n\nThe seg6_input() function is responsible for adding the SRH into a\npacket, delegating the operation to the seg6_input_core(). This function\nuses the skb_cow_head() to ensure that there is sufficient headroom in\nthe sk_buff for accommodating the link-layer header.\nIn the event that the skb_cow_header() function fails, the\nseg6_input_core() catches the error but it does not release the sk_buff,\nwhich will result in a memory leak.\n\nThis issue was introduced in commit af3b5158b89d (\"ipv6: sr: fix BUG due\nto headroom too small after SRH push\") and persists even after commit\n7a3f5b0de364 (\"netfilter: add netfilter hooks to SRv6 data plane\"),\nwhere the entire seg6_input() code was refactored to deal with netfilter\nhooks.\n\nThe proposed patch addresses the identified memory leak by requiring the\nseg6_input_core() function to release the sk_buff in the event that\nskb_cow_head() fails.",
