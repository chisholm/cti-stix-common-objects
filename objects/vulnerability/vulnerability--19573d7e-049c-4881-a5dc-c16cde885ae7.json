            "description": "Intel Driver & Support Assistant Link Following Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Intel Driver & Support Assistant. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the DSA Service. By creating a symbolic link, an attacker can abuse the service to write a file. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM.
