            "description": "D-Link DAP-2622 Telnet CLI Command Injection Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of D-Link DAP-2622. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the CLI service, which listens on TCP port 23. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-20051.",
