            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: xhci: Check for xhci->interrupters being allocated in xhci_mem_clearup()\n\nIf xhci_mem_init() fails, it calls into xhci_mem_cleanup() to mop\nup the damage. If it fails early enough, before xhci->interrupters\nis allocated but after xhci->max_interrupters has been set, which\nhappens in most (all?) cases, things get uglier, as xhci_mem_cleanup()\nunconditionally derefences xhci->interrupters. With prejudice.\n\nGate the interrupt freeing loop with a check on xhci->interrupters\nbeing non-NULL.\n\nFound while debugging a DMA allocation issue that led the XHCI driver\non this exact path.",
