            "description": "The Category and Taxonomy Meta Fields plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the image meta field value in the 'wpaft_add_meta_textinput' function in versions up to, and including, 1.0.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with editor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.",
