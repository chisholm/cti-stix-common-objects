            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/hugetlb.c: fix UAF of vma in hugetlb fault pathway\n\nSyzbot reports a UAF in hugetlb_fault().  This happens because\nvmf_anon_prepare() could drop the per-VMA lock and allow the current VMA\nto be freed before hugetlb_vma_unlock_read() is called.\n\nWe can fix this by using a modified version of vmf_anon_prepare() that\ndoesn't release the VMA lock on failure, and then release it ourselves\nafter hugetlb_vma_unlock_read().",
