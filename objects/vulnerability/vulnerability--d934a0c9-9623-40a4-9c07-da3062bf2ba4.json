            "description": "The Animated Headline plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'animated-headline' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 4.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
