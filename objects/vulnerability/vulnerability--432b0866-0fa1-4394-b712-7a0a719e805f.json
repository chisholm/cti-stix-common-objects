            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nNFSv4.2: fix reference count leaks in _nfs42_proc_copy_notify()\n\n[You don't often get email from xiongx18@fudan.edu.cn. Learn why this is important at http://aka.ms/LearnAboutSenderIdentification.]\n\nThe reference counting issue happens in two error paths in the\nfunction _nfs42_proc_copy_notify(). In both error paths, the function\nsimply returns the error code and forgets to balance the refcount of\nobject `ctx`, bumped by get_nfs_open_context() earlier, which may\ncause refcount leaks.\n\nFix it by balancing refcount of the `ctx` object before the function\nreturns in both error paths.",
