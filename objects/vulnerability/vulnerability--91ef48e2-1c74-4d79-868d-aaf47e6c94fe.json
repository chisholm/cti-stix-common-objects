            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nenetc: Fix illegal access when reading affinity_hint\n\nirq_set_affinity_hit() stores a reference to the cpumask_t\nparameter in the irq descriptor, and that reference can be\naccessed later from irq_affinity_hint_proc_show(). Since\nthe cpu_mask parameter passed to irq_set_affinity_hit() has\nonly temporary storage (it's on the stack memory), later\naccesses to it are illegal. Thus reads from the corresponding\nprocfs affinity_hint file can result in paging request oops.\n\nThe issue is fixed by the get_cpu_mask() helper, which provides\na permanent storage for the cpumask_t parameter.",
