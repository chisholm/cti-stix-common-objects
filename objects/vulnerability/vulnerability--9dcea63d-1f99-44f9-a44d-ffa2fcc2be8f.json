            "description": "A vulnerability in the Switch Integrated Security Features (SISF) of Cisco IOS Software, Cisco IOS XE Software, Cisco NX-OS Software, and Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) AireOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of DHCPv6 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted DHCPv6 packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.",
