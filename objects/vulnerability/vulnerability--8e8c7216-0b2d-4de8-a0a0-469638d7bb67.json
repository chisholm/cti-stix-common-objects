            "description": "The Yuki theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including 1.3.14. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the reset_customizer_options() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to reset the themes settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
