            "description": "The Miniorange OTP Verification with Firebase plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions up to, and including, 3.6.0. This is due to missing validation on the token being supplied during the otp login through the plugin. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they know the phone number associated with that user.",
