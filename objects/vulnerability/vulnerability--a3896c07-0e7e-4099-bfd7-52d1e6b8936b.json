            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amd/display: Fix potential null pointer dereference in dc_dmub_srv\n\nFixes potential null pointer dereference warnings in the\ndc_dmub_srv_cmd_list_queue_execute() and dc_dmub_srv_is_hw_pwr_up()\nfunctions.\n\nIn both functions, the 'dc_dmub_srv' variable was being dereferenced\nbefore it was checked for null. This could lead to a null pointer\ndereference if 'dc_dmub_srv' is null. The fix is to check if\n'dc_dmub_srv' is null before dereferencing it.\n\nThus moving the null checks for 'dc_dmub_srv' to the beginning of the\nfunctions to ensure that 'dc_dmub_srv' is not null when it is\ndereferenced.\n\nFound by smatch & thus fixing the below:\ndrivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/dc_dmub_srv.c:133 dc_dmub_srv_cmd_list_queue_execute() warn: variable dereferenced before check 'dc_dmub_srv' (see line 128)\ndrivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/dc_dmub_srv.c:1167 dc_dmub_srv_is_hw_pwr_up() warn: variable dereferenced before check 'dc_dmub_srv' (see line 1164)",
