            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: nl80211: fix bounds checker error in nl80211_parse_sched_scan\n\nThe channels array in the cfg80211_scan_request has a __counted_by\nattribute attached to it, which points to the n_channels variable. This\nattribute is used in bounds checking, and if it is not set before the\narray is filled, then the bounds sanitizer will issue a warning or a\nkernel panic if CONFIG_UBSAN_TRAP is set.\n\nThis patch sets the size of allocated memory as the initial value for\nn_channels. It is updated with the actual number of added elements after\nthe array is filled.",
