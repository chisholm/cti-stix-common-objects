            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nrtc: tps6594: Fix integer overflow on 32bit systems\n\nThe problem is this multiply in tps6594_rtc_set_offset()\n\n\ttmp = offset * TICKS_PER_HOUR;\n\nThe \"tmp\" variable is an s64 but \"offset\" is a long in the\n(-277774)-277774 range.  On 32bit systems a long can hold numbers up to\napproximately two billion.  The number of TICKS_PER_HOUR is really large,\n(32768 * 3600) or roughly a hundred million.  When you start multiplying\nby a hundred million it doesn't take long to overflow the two billion\nmark.\n\nProbably the safest way to fix this is to change the type of\nTICKS_PER_HOUR to long long because it's such a large number.",
