            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nInput: powermate - fix use-after-free in powermate_config_complete\n\nsyzbot has found a use-after-free bug [1] in the powermate driver. This\nhappens when the device is disconnected, which leads to a memory free from\nthe powermate_device struct.  When an asynchronous control message\ncompletes after the kfree and its callback is invoked, the lock does not\nexist anymore and hence the bug.\n\nUse usb_kill_urb() on pm->config to cancel any in-progress requests upon\ndevice disconnection.\n\n[1] https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=0434ac83f907a1dbdd1e",
