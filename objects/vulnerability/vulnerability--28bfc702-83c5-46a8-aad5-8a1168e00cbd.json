            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/nouveau: fix off by one in BIOS boundary checking\n\nBounds checking when parsing init scripts embedded in the BIOS reject\naccess to the last byte. This causes driver initialization to fail on\nApple eMac's with GeForce 2 MX GPUs, leaving the system with no working\nconsole.\n\nThis is probably only seen on OpenFirmware machines like PowerPC Macs\nbecause the BIOS image provided by OF is only the used parts of the ROM,\nnot a power-of-two blocks read from PCI directly so PCs always have\nempty bytes at the end that are never accessed.",
