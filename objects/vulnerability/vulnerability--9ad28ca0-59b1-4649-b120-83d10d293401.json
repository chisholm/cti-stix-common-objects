In org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-livetable-ui starting with version 3.5-milestone-1 and prior to versions 14.10.9 and 15.3-rc-1, the mail obfuscation configuration was not fully taken into account and is was still possible by obfuscated emails. This has been patched in XWiki 14.10.9 and XWiki 15.3-rc-1. A workaround is to modify the page `XWiki.LiveTableResultsMacros` following the patch.",
