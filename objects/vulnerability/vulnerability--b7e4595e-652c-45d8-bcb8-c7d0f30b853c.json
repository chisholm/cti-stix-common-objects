This may cause the command to run directly on a shard, leading to either degradation of query performance, or to revealing chunk boundaries through timing side channels. This affects MongoDB Server v5.0 versions, prior to 5.0.22, MongoDB Server v6.0 versions, prior to 6.0.11 and MongoDB Server v7.0 versions prior to 7.0.3.",
