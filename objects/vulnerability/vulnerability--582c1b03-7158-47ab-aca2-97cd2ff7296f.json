As Apache Archiva has been retired, we do not expect to release a version of Apache Archiva that fixes this issue. You are recommended to look into migrating to a different solution, or isolate your instance from any untrusted users.\n\nNOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer\n\n",
