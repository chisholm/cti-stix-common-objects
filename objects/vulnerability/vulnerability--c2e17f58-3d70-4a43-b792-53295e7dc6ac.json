            "description": "Publify is a self hosted Web publishing platform on Rails. Prior to version 10.0.1 of Publify, corresponding to versions prior to 10.0.2 of the `publify_core` rubygem, publisher on a `publify` application is able to perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack on an administrator using the redirect functionality. The exploitation of this XSS vulnerability requires the administrator to click a malicious link. An attack could attempt to hide their payload by using HTML, or other encodings, as to not make it obvious to an administrator that this is a malicious link. A publisher may attempt to use this vulnerability to escalate their privileges and become an administrator. Version 10.0.1 of Publify and version 10.0.2 of the `publify_core` rubygem fix the issue.",
