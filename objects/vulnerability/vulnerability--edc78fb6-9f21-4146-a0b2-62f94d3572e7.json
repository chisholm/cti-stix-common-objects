For tear down scenario, fn is only freed\nafter fail to allocate ir_domain, though it also should be freed in case\ndmar_enable_qi returns error.\n\nBesides free fn, irq_domain and ir_msi_domain need to be removed as well\nif intel_setup_irq_remapping fails to enable queued invalidation.\n\nImprove the rewinding path by add out_free_ir_domain and out_free_fwnode\nlables per Baolu's suggestion.",
