            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amdkfd: Use dynamic allocation for CU occupancy array in 'kfd_get_cu_occupancy()'\n\nThe `kfd_get_cu_occupancy` function previously declared a large\n`cu_occupancy` array as a local variable, which could lead to stack\noverflows due to excessive stack usage. This commit replaces the static\narray allocation with dynamic memory allocation using `kcalloc`,\nthereby reducing the stack size.\n\nThis change avoids the risk of stack overflows in kernel space,  in\nscenarios where `AMDGPU_MAX_QUEUES` is large. The  allocated memory is\nfreed using `kfree` before the function returns  to prevent memory\nleaks.\n\nFixes the below with gcc W=1:\ndrivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../amdkfd/kfd_process.c: In function ‘kfd_get_cu_occupancy’:\ndrivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../amdkfd/kfd_process.c:322:1: warning: the frame size of 1056 bytes is larger than 1024 bytes [-Wframe-larger-than=]\n  322 | }\n      | ^",
