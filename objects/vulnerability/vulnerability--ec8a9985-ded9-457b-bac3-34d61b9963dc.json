            "description": "The Download Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via a user's Display Name in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.86 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This vulnerability requires social engineering to successfully exploit, and the impact would be very limited due to the attacker requiring a user to login as the user with the injected payload for execution.",
