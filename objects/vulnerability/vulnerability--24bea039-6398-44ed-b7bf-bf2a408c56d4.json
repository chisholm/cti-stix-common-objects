            "description": "The Ecwid by Lightspeed Ecommerce Shopping Cart plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 6.12.27. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the ecwid_deactivate_feedback() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to send deactivation messages on behalf of a site owner via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
