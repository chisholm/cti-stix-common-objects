            "description": "The NextScripts: Social Networks Auto-Poster plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the HTTP_USER_AGENT header in all versions up to, and including, 4.4.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This requires the victim to select view \"All Cron Events\" in order for the injection to fire.",
