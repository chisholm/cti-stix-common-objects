            "description": "SAP NetWeaver allows an attacker to bypass authorization checks, enabling them to view portions of ABAP code that would normally require additional validation. Once logged into the ABAP system, the attacker can run a specific transaction that exposes sensitive system code without proper authorization. This vulnerability compromises the confidentiality.",
