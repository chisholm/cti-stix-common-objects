            "description": "InstantCMS is a free and open source content management system. An open redirect was found in the ICMS2 application version 2.16.2 when being redirected after modifying one's own user profile. An attacker could trick a victim into visiting their web application, thinking they are still present on the ICMS2 application. They could then host a website stating \"To update your profile, please enter your password,\" upon which the user may type their password and send it to the attacker. As of time of publication, a patched version is not available.",
