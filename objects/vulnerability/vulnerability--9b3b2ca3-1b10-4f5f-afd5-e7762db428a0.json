            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nHID: usbhid: fix info leak in hid_submit_ctrl\n\nIn hid_submit_ctrl(), the way of calculating the report length doesn't\ntake into account that report->size can be zero. When running the\nsyzkaller reproducer, a report of size 0 causes hid_submit_ctrl) to\ncalculate transfer_buffer_length as 16384. When this urb is passed to\nthe usb core layer, KMSAN reports an info leak of 16384 bytes.\n\nTo fix this, first modify hid_report_len() to account for the zero\nreport size case by using DIV_ROUND_UP for the division. Then, call it\nfrom hid_submit_ctrl().",
