            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nxen/netfront: harden netfront against event channel storms\n\nThe Xen netfront driver is still vulnerable for an attack via excessive\nnumber of events sent by the backend. Fix that by using lateeoi event\nchannels.\n\nFor being able to detect the case of no rx responses being added while\nthe carrier is down a new lock is needed in order to update and test\nrsp_cons and the number of seen unconsumed responses atomically.\n\nThis is part of XSA-391\n\n---\nV2:\n- don't eoi irq in case of interface set broken (Jan Beulich)\n- handle carrier off + no new responses added (Jan Beulich)\nV3:\n- add rx_ prefix to rsp_unconsumed (Jan Beulich)\n- correct xennet_set_rx_rsp_cons() spelling (Jan Beulich)",
