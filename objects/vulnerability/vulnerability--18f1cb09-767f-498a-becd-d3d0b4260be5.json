            "description": "Starting in Python 3.12.0, the asyncio._SelectorSocketTransport.writelines()\n method would not \"pause\" writing and signal to the Protocol to drain \nthe buffer to the wire once the write buffer reached the \"high-water \nmark\". Because of this, Protocols would not periodically drain the write\n buffer potentially leading to memory exhaustion.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis\n vulnerability likely impacts a small number of users, you must be using\n Python 3.12.0 or later, on macOS or Linux, using the asyncio module \nwith protocols, and using .writelines() method which had new \nzero-copy-on-write behavior in Python 3.12.0 and later. If not all of \nthese factors are true then your usage of Python is unaffected.",
