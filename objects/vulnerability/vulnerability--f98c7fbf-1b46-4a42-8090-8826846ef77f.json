            "description": "A vulnerability in the management API of Cisco Catalyst Center, formerly Cisco DNA Center, could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to read and modify the outgoing proxy configuration settings.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to the lack of authentication in an API endpoint. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a request to the affected API of a Catalyst Center device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view or modify the outgoing proxy configuration, which could disrupt internet traffic from Cisco Catalyst Center or may allow the attacker to intercept outbound internet traffic.",
