            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsctp: sysctl: rto_min/max: avoid using current->nsproxy\n\nAs mentioned in a previous commit of this series, using the 'net'\nstructure via 'current' is not recommended for different reasons:\n\n- Inconsistency: getting info from the reader's/writer's netns vs only\n  from the opener's netns.\n\n- current->nsproxy can be NULL in some cases, resulting in an 'Oops'\n  (null-ptr-deref), e.g. when the current task is exiting, as spotted by\n  syzbot [1] using acct(2).\n\nThe 'net' structure can be obtained from the table->data using\ncontainer_of().\n\nNote that table->data could also be used directly, as this is the only\nmember needed from the 'net' structure, but that would increase the size\nof this fix, to use '*data' everywhere 'net->sctp.rto_min/max' is used.",
