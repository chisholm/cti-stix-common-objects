            "description": "A vulnerability in aimhubio/aim version 3.25.0 allows for a denial of service through the misuse of the sshfs-client. The tracking server, which is single-threaded, can be made unresponsive by requesting it to connect to an unresponsive socket via sshfs. The lack of an additional timeout setting in the sshfs-client causes the server to hang for a significant amount of time, preventing it from responding to other requests.",
