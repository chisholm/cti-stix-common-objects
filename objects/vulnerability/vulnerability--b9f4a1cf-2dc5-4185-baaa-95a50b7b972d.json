            "description": "The Auth0 Next.js SDK is a library for implementing user authentication in Next.js applications. Versions starting from 4.0.1 and prior to 4.5.1, do not invoke `.setExpirationTime` when generating a JWE token for the session. As a result, the JWE does not contain an internal expiration claim. While the session cookie may expire or be cleared, the JWE remains valid. This issue has been patched in version 4.5.1.",
