This vulnerability allows remote attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of NETGEAR ProSAFE Network Management System. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the clearAlertByIds function. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to construct SQL queries. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges to resources normally protected from the user. Was ZDI-CAN-21875.",
