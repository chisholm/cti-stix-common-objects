            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\num: Add winch to winch_handlers before registering winch IRQ\n\nRegistering a winch IRQ is racy, an interrupt may occur before the winch is\nadded to the winch_handlers list.\n\nIf that happens, register_winch_irq() adds to that list a winch that is\nscheduled to be (or has already been) freed, causing a panic later in\nwinch_cleanup().\n\nAvoid the race by adding the winch to the winch_handlers list before\nregistering the IRQ, and rolling back if um_request_irq() fails.",
