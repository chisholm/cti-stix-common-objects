            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nHID: hid-thrustmaster: fix stack-out-of-bounds read in usb_check_int_endpoints()\n\nSyzbot[1] has detected a stack-out-of-bounds read of the ep_addr array from\nhid-thrustmaster driver. This array is passed to usb_check_int_endpoints\nfunction from usb.c core driver, which executes a for loop that iterates\nover the elements of the passed array. Not finding a null element at the end of\nthe array, it tries to read the next, non-existent element, crashing the kernel.\n\nTo fix this, a 0 element was added at the end of the array to break the for\nloop.\n\n[1] https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=9c9179ac46169c56c1ad",
