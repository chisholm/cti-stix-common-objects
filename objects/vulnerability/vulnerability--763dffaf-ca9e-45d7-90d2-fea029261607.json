            "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco&nbsp;Prime Access Registrar Appliance could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting attack against a user of the interface. The attacker would require valid credentials for the device.\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.",
