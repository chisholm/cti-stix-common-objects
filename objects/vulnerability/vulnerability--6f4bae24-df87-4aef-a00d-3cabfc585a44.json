            "description": "The SoJ SoundSlides plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the soj_soundslides_options_subpanel() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.",
