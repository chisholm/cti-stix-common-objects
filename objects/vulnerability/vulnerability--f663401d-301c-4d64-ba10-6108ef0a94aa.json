            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\naoe: fix the potential use-after-free problem in more places\n\nFor fixing CVE-2023-6270, f98364e92662 (\"aoe: fix the potential\nuse-after-free problem in aoecmd_cfg_pkts\") makes tx() calling dev_put()\ninstead of doing in aoecmd_cfg_pkts(). It avoids that the tx() runs\ninto use-after-free.\n\nThen Nicolai Stange found more places in aoe have potential use-after-free\nproblem with tx(). e.g. revalidate(), aoecmd_ata_rw(), resend(), probe()\nand aoecmd_cfg_rsp(). Those functions also use aoenet_xmit() to push\npacket to tx queue. So they should also use dev_hold() to increase the\nrefcnt of skb->dev.\n\nOn the other hand, moving dev_put() to tx() causes that the refcnt of\nskb->dev be reduced to a negative value, because corresponding\ndev_hold() are not called in revalidate(), aoecmd_ata_rw(), resend(),\nprobe(), and aoecmd_cfg_rsp(). This patch fixed this issue.",
