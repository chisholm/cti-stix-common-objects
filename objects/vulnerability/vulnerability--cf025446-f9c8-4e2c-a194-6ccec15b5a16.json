            "description": "Vyper is a pythonic Smart Contract Language for the Ethereum virtual machine. In versions 0.3.10 and prior, incorrect values can be logged when `raw_log` builtin is called with memory or storage arguments to be used as topics. A contract search was performed and no vulnerable contracts were found in production. The `build_IR` function of the `RawLog` class fails to properly unwrap the variables provided as topics. Consequently, incorrect values are logged as topics. As of time of publication, no fixed version is available.",
