            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: usb: lan78xx: Fix double free issue with interrupt buffer allocation\n\nIn lan78xx_probe(), the buffer `buf` was being freed twice: once\nimplicitly through `usb_free_urb(dev->urb_intr)` with the\n`URB_FREE_BUFFER` flag and again explicitly by `kfree(buf)`. This caused\na double free issue.\n\nTo resolve this, reordered `kmalloc()` and `usb_alloc_urb()` calls to\nsimplify the initialization sequence and removed the redundant\n`kfree(buf)`.  Now, `buf` is allocated after `usb_alloc_urb()`, ensuring\nit is correctly managed by  `usb_fill_int_urb()` and freed by\n`usb_free_urb()` as intended.",
