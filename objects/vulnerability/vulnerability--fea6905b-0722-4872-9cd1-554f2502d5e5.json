            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnilfs2: protect references to superblock parameters exposed in sysfs\n\nThe superblock buffers of nilfs2 can not only be overwritten at runtime\nfor modifications/repairs, but they are also regularly swapped, replaced\nduring resizing, and even abandoned when degrading to one side due to\nbacking device issues.  So, accessing them requires mutual exclusion using\nthe reader/writer semaphore \"nilfs->ns_sem\".\n\nSome sysfs attribute show methods read this superblock buffer without the\nnecessary mutual exclusion, which can cause problems with pointer\ndereferencing and memory access, so fix it.",
