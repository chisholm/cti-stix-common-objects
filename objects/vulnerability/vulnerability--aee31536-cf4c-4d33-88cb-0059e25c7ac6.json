            "description": "A vulnerability in the Dynamic Access Policies (DAP) feature of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload unexpectedly. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid remote access VPN user credentials on the affected device.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to improper validation of data in HTTPS POST requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTPS POST request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.",
