            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nSUNRPC: Fix a slow server-side memory leak with RPC-over-TCP\n\nJan Schunk reports that his small NFS servers suffer from memory\nexhaustion after just a few days. A bisect shows that commit\ne18e157bb5c8 (\"SUNRPC: Send RPC message on TCP with a single\nsock_sendmsg() call\") is the first bad commit.\n\nThat commit assumed that sock_sendmsg() releases all the pages in\nthe underlying bio_vec array, but the reality is that it doesn't.\nsvc_xprt_release() releases the rqst's response pages, but the\nrecord marker page fragment isn't one of those, so it is never\nreleased.\n\nThis is a narrow fix that can be applied to stable kernels. A\nmore extensive fix is in the works.",
