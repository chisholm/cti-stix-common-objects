            "description": "A vulnerability in Cisco Duo Authentication for Windows Logon and RDP could allow an authenticated, physical attacker to bypass secondary authentication and access an affected Windows device. \r\n\r This vulnerability is due to a failure to invalidate locally created trusted sessions after a reboot of the affected device. An attacker with primary user credentials could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to authenticate to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access the affected device without valid permissions.",
