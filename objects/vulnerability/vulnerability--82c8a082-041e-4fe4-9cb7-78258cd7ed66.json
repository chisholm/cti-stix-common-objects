            "description": "An authenticated user can upload arbitrary files in the upload \nfunction for collection preview images.

It is also possible to upload SVG files that \ninclude nested XML entities. Those are parsed when a user visits the \ndirect URL of the collection preview image, which may be utilized for a \nDenial of Service attack.\n\nThis issue affects edu-sharing: <8.0.8-RC2, <8.1.4-RC0, <9.0.0-RC19.",
