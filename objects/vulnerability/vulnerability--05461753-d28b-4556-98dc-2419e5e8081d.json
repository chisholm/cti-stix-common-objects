            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amdgpu: change vm->task_info handling\n\nThis patch changes the handling and lifecycle of vm->task_info object.\nThe major changes are:\n- vm->task_info is a dynamically allocated ptr now, and its uasge is\n  reference counted.\n- introducing two new helper funcs for task_info lifecycle management\n    - amdgpu_vm_get_task_info: reference counts up task_info before\n      returning this info\n    - amdgpu_vm_put_task_info: reference counts down task_info\n- last put to task_info() frees task_info from the vm.\n\nThis patch also does logistical changes required for existing usage\nof vm->task_info.\n\nV2: Do not block all the prints when task_info not found (Felix)\n\nV3: Fixed review comments from Felix\n   - Fix wrong indentation\n   - No debug message for -ENOMEM\n   - Add NULL check for task_info\n   - Do not duplicate the debug messages (ti vs no ti)\n   - Get first reference of task_info in vm_init(), put last\n     in vm_fini()\n\nV4: Fixed review comments from Felix\n   - fix double reference increment in create_task_info\n   - change amdgpu_vm_get_task_info_pasid\n   - additional changes in amdgpu_gem.c while porting",
