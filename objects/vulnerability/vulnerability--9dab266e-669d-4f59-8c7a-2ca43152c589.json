            "description": "In Splunk Enterprise versions below 9.4.1, 9.3.3, 9.2.5, and 9.1.8 and Splunk Cloud Platform versions below 9.3.2408.107, 9.2.2406.111, and 9.1.2308.214, a low-privileged user that does not hold the \"admin\" or \"power\" Splunk roles could run a saved search with a risky command using the permissions of a higher-privileged user to bypass the SPL safeguards for risky commands on the \"/services/streams/search\" endpoint through its \"q\" parameter. The vulnerability requires the attacker to phish the victim by tricking them into initiating a request within their browser. The authenticated user should not be able to exploit the vulnerability at will.",
