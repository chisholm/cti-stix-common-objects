            "description": "IBM Personal Communications 14.0.6 through 15.0.1 includes a Windows service that is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) and local privilege escalation (LPE). The vulnerability allows any unprivileged user with network access to a target computer to run commands with full privileges in the context of NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM. This allows for a low privileged attacker to move laterally to affected systems and to escalate their privileges.  IBM X-Force ID:  281619.",
