            "description": "The igumbi Online Booking plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'igumbi_calendar' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.40 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
