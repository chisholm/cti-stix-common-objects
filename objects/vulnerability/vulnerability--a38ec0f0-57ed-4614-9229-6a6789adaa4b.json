            "description": "Develocity (formerly Gradle Enterprise) before 2024.1.8 has Incorrect Access Control. Project-level access control configuration was introduced in Enterprise Config schema version 8. Migration functionality from schema version 8 to versions 9 and 10 (in affected vulnerable versions) does not include the projects section of the configuration. This leads to all of the project settings being reset to their defaults when the old schema is loaded. In the case of projects.enabled, the default is false. Thus, using an enterprise config v8 results in Project level access control being disabled, even if it was previously enabled, and previously restricted project information disclosed. Most commonly, this occurs when a Develocity instance is upgraded from an earlier version. Specifically, this occurs if: Develocity 2023.3.X is upgraded to 2023.4.X; Develocity 2023.3.X is upgraded to 2024.1.X up to and including 2024.1.7; or Develocity 2023.4.X is upgraded to 2024.1.X up to and including 2024.1.7. The flaw does not occur when upgrading to a fixed version. An upgrade can only be triggered via administrator access, and cannot be forced by an external attacker.",
