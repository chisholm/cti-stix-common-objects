            "description": "A vulnerability was identified in the kjd/idna library, specifically within the `idna.encode()` function, affecting version 3.6. The issue arises from the function's handling of crafted input strings, which can lead to quadratic complexity and consequently, a denial of service condition. This vulnerability is triggered by a crafted input that causes the `idna.encode()` function to process the input with considerable computational load, significantly increasing the processing time in a quadratic manner relative to the input size.",
