            "description": "Voltronic Power ViewPower Pro doDocument XML External Entity Processing Information Disclosure Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Voltronic Power ViewPower Pro. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the doDocument method. Due to the improper restriction of XML External Entity (XXE) references, a crafted document specifying a URI causes the XML parser to access the URI and embed the contents back into the XML document for further processing. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to disclose information in the context of LOCAL SERVICE. Was ZDI-CAN-22081.",
