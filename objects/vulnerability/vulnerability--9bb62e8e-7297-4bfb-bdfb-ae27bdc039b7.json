            "description": "Unified Automation UaGateway NodeManagerOpcUa Use-After-Free Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Unified Automation UaGateway. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability when the product is in its default configuration.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of NodeManagerOpcUa objects. The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of SYSTEM. Was ZDI-CAN-20577.",
