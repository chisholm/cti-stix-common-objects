            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndm-verity: restart or panic on an I/O error\n\nMaxim Suhanov reported that dm-verity doesn't crash if an I/O error\nhappens. In theory, this could be used to subvert security, because an\nattacker can create sectors that return error with the Write Uncorrectable\ncommand. Some programs may misbehave if they have to deal with EIO.\n\nThis commit fixes dm-verity, so that if \"panic_on_corruption\" or\n\"restart_on_corruption\" was specified and an I/O error happens, the\nmachine will panic or restart.\n\nThis commit also changes kernel_restart to emergency_restart -\nkernel_restart calls reboot notifiers and these reboot notifiers may wait\nfor the bio that failed. emergency_restart doesn't call the notifiers.",
