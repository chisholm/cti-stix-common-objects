            "description": "Paessler PRTG Network Monitor SNMP Cross-Site Scripting Authentication Bypass Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to bypass authentication on affected installations of Paessler PRTG Network Monitor. Some user interaction on the part of an administrator is required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the PRTG Network Monitor web interface. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can lead to the injection of an arbitrary script. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to bypass authentication on the system. Was ZDI-CAN-23371.",
