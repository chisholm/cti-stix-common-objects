An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted HTTP request to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to upload files to a location that should be restricted. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid Read-Only Administrator&nbsp;credentials.",
