            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\natl1c: Work around the DMA RX overflow issue\n\nThis is based on alx driver commit 881d0327db37 (\"net: alx: Work around\nthe DMA RX overflow issue\").\n\nThe alx and atl1c drivers had RX overflow error which was why a custom\nallocator was created to avoid certain addresses. The simpler workaround\nthen created for alx driver, but not for atl1c due to lack of tester.\n\nInstead of using a custom allocator, check the allocated skb address and\nuse skb_reserve() to move away from problematic 0x...fc0 address.\n\nTested on AR8131 on Acer 4540.",
