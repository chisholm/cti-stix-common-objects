            "description": "YesWiki is a wiki system written in PHP. Prior to version 4.5.4, the `/?BazaR` endpoint and `idformulaire` parameter are vulnerable to cross-site scripting. An attacker can use a reflected cross-site scripting attack to steal cookies from an authenticated user by having them click on a malicious link. Stolen cookies allow the attacker to take over the userâ€™s session. This vulnerability may also allow attackers to deface the website or embed malicious content. This issue has been patched in version 4.5.4.",
