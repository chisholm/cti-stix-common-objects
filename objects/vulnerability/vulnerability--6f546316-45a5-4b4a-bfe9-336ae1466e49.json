            "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center (FMC) Software, formerly Firepower Management Center Software, could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with Administrator-level privileges to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of certain HTTP request parameters that are sent to the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the Cisco FMC web-based management interface and sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute commands as the root user on the affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need Administrator-level credentials.",
