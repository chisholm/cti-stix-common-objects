            "description": "lakeFS is an open-source tool that transforms object storage into a Git-like repository. Existing lakeFS users who have issued credentials to users who have been deleted are affected by this vulnerability. When creating a new user with the same username as a deleted user, that user will inherit all of the previous user's credentials. This issue has been addressed in release version 1.33.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. The only known workaround for those who cannot upgrade is to not reuse usernames.",
