            "description": "NocoDB is software for building databases as spreadsheets. The API endpoint related to the password reset function is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site-Scripting. The endpoint /api/v1/db/auth/password/reset/:tokenId is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site-Scripting. The flaw occurs due to implementation of the client-side template engine ejs, specifically on file resetPassword.ts where the template is using the insecure function “<%-“, which is rendered by the function renderPasswordReset. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.258.0.",
