            "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Evolved Programmable Network Manager (EPNM) and Cisco Prime Infrastructure could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against users of the interface of an affected system.\r\n\r The vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inserting malicious code into specific data fields in the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid administrative credentials.\r\n\r    \r\n\r  {{value}} [\"%7b%7bvalue%7d%7d\"])}]]",
