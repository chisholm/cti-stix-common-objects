Prior to 5.9.1, generator-jhipster-entity-audit allows unsafe reflection when having Javers selected as Entity Audit Framework. If an attacker manages to place some malicious classes into the classpath and also has access to these REST interface for calling the mentioned REST endpoints, using these lines of code can lead to unintended remote code execution. This vulnerability is fixed in 5.9.1.",
