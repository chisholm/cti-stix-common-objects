            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: always report error in run_one_delayed_ref()\n\nCurrently we have a btrfs_debug() for run_one_delayed_ref() failure, but\nif end users hit such problem, there will be no chance that\nbtrfs_debug() is enabled.  This can lead to very little useful info for\ndebugging.\n\nThis patch will:\n\n- Add extra info for error reporting\n  Including:\n  * logical bytenr\n  * num_bytes\n  * type\n  * action\n  * ref_mod\n\n- Replace the btrfs_debug() with btrfs_err()\n\n- Move the error reporting into run_one_delayed_ref()\n  This is to avoid use-after-free, the @node can be freed in the caller.\n\nThis error should only be triggered at most once.\n\nAs if run_one_delayed_ref() failed, we trigger the error message, then\ncausing the call chain to error out:\n\nbtrfs_run_delayed_refs()\n`- btrfs_run_delayed_refs()\n   `- btrfs_run_delayed_refs_for_head()\n      `- run_one_delayed_ref()\n\nAnd we will abort the current transaction in btrfs_run_delayed_refs().\nIf we have to run delayed refs for the abort transaction,\nrun_one_delayed_ref() will just cleanup the refs and do nothing, thus no\nnew error messages would be output.",
