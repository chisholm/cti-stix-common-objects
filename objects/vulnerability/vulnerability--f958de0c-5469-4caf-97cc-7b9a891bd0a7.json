            "description": "Computer Vision Annotation Tool (CVAT) is an interactive video and image annotation tool for computer vision. An attacker with a CVAT account may retrieve certain information about any project, task, job or membership resource on the CVAT instance. The information exposed in this way is the same as the information returned on a GET request to the resource. In addition, the attacker can also alter the default source and target storage associated with any project or task. Upgrade to CVAT 2.19.1 or any later version to fix the issue.",
