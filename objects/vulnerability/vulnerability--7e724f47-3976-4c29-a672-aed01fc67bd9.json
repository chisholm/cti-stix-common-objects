            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: cfg80211: fix out-of-bounds access during multi-link element defragmentation\n\nCurrently during the multi-link element defragmentation process, the\nmulti-link element length added to the total IEs length when calculating\nthe length of remaining IEs after the multi-link element in\ncfg80211_defrag_mle(). This could lead to out-of-bounds access if the\nmulti-link element or its corresponding fragment elements are the last\nelements in the IEs buffer.\n\nTo address this issue, correctly calculate the remaining IEs length by\ndeducting the multi-link element end offset from total IEs end offset.",
