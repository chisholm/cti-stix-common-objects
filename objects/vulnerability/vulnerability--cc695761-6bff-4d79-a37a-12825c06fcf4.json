            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nRDMA/hfi1: Fix potential integer multiplication overflow errors\n\nWhen multiplying of different types, an overflow is possible even when\nstoring the result in a larger type. This is because the conversion is\ndone after the multiplication. So arithmetic overflow and thus in\nincorrect value is possible.\n\nCorrect an instance of this in the inter packet delay calculation.  Fix by\nensuring one of the operands is u64 which will promote the other to u64 as\nwell ensuring no overflow.",
