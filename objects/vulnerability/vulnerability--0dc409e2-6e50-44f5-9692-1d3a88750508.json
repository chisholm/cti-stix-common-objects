            "description": "Improper Certificate Validation vulnerability in LibreOffice \"LibreOfficeKit\" mode disables TLS certification verification\n\nLibreOfficeKit can be used for accessing LibreOffice functionality \nthrough C/C++. Typically this is used by third party components to reuse\n LibreOffice as a library to convert, view or otherwise interact with \ndocuments.\n\nLibreOffice internally makes use of \"curl\" to fetch remote resources such as images hosted on webservers.\n\nIn\n affected versions of LibreOffice, when used in LibreOfficeKit mode \nonly, then curl's TLS certification verification was disabled \n(CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER of false)\n\nIn the fixed versions curl operates in LibreOfficeKit mode the same as in standard mode with CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER of true.\n\nThis issue affects LibreOffice before version 24.2.4.",
