            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Fix UAF via mismatching bpf_prog/attachment RCU flavors\n\nUprobes always use bpf_prog_run_array_uprobe() under tasks-trace-RCU\nprotection. But it is possible to attach a non-sleepable BPF program to a\nuprobe, and non-sleepable BPF programs are freed via normal RCU (see\n__bpf_prog_put_noref()). This leads to UAF of the bpf_prog because a normal\nRCU grace period does not imply a tasks-trace-RCU grace period.\n\nFix it by explicitly waiting for a tasks-trace-RCU grace period after\nremoving the attachment of a bpf_prog to a perf_event.",
