When the ax25 device is shutting down, the\nax25_dev_device_down() drops the reference count of net_device one\nor zero times depending on if we goto unlock_put or not, which will\ncause memory leak.\n\nIn order to solve the above issue, decrease the reference count of\nnet_device after dev->ax25_ptr is set to null.",
