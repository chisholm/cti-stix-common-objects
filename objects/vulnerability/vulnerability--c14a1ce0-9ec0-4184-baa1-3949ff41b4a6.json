            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmaple_tree: fix mas_empty_area_rev() null pointer dereference\n\nCurrently the code calls mas_start() followed by mas_data_end() if the\nmaple state is MA_START, but mas_start() may return with the maple state\nnode == NULL.  This will lead to a null pointer dereference when checking\ninformation in the NULL node, which is done in mas_data_end().\n\nAvoid setting the offset if there is no node by waiting until after the\nmaple state is checked for an empty or single entry state.\n\nA user could trigger the events to cause a kernel oops by unmapping all\nvmas to produce an empty maple tree, then mapping a vma that would cause\nthe scenario described above.",
