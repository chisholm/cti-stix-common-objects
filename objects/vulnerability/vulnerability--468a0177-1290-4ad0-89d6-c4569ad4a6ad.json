            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: storvsc: Fix swiotlb bounce buffer leak in confidential VM\n\nstorvsc_queuecommand() maps the scatter/gather list using scsi_dma_map(),\nwhich in a confidential VM allocates swiotlb bounce buffers. If the I/O\nsubmission fails in storvsc_do_io(), the I/O is typically retried by higher\nlevel code, but the bounce buffer memory is never freed.  The mostly like\ncause of I/O submission failure is a full VMBus channel ring buffer, which\nis not uncommon under high I/O loads.  Eventually enough bounce buffer\nmemory leaks that the confidential VM can't do any I/O. The same problem\ncan arise in a non-confidential VM with kernel boot parameter\nswiotlb=force.\n\nFix this by doing scsi_dma_unmap() in the case of an I/O submission\nerror, which frees the bounce buffer memory.",
