            "description": "Android based smartphones from vendors such as Ulefone and Krüger&Matz contain \"com.pri.factorytest\" application preloaded onto devices during manufacturing process.\nThe application \"com.pri.factorytest\" (version name: 1.0, version code: 1) exposes a ”com.pri.factorytest.emmc.FactoryResetService“ service allowing any application to perform a factory reset of the device. \nApplication update did not increment the APK version. Instead, it was bundled in OS builds released later than December 2024 (Ulefone) and most probably March 2025 (Krüger&Matz, although the vendor has not confirmed it, so newer releases might be vulnerable as well).",
