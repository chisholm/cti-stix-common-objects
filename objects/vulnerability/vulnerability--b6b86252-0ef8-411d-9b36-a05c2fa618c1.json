            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ne1000e: change usleep_range to udelay in PHY mdic access\n\nThis is a partial revert of commit 6dbdd4de0362 (\"e1000e: Workaround\nfor sporadic MDI error on Meteor Lake systems\"). The referenced commit\nused usleep_range inside the PHY access routines, which are sometimes\ncalled from an atomic context. This can lead to a kernel panic in some\nscenarios, such as cable disconnection and reconnection on vPro systems.\n\nSolve this by changing the usleep_range calls back to udelay.",
