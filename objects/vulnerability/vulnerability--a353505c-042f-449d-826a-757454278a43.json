            "description": "Evmos is the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Hub on the Cosmos Network. There is an issue with how to liquid stake using Safe which itself is a contract. The bug only appears when there is a local state change together with an ICS20 transfer in the same function and uses the contract's balance, that is using the contract address as the sender parameter in an ICS20 transfer using the ICS20 precompile. This is in essence the \"infinite money glitch\" allowing contracts to double the supply of Evmos after each transaction.The issue has been patched in versions >=V18.1.0. ",
