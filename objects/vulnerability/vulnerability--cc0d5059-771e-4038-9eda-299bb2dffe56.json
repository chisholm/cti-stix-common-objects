            "description": "A vulnerability in the upload module of Cisco RV340 and RV345 Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to insufficient boundary checks when processing specific HTTP requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user on the underlying operating system of the device.",
