            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nhwrng: core - Fix page fault dead lock on mmap-ed hwrng\n\nThere is a dead-lock in the hwrng device read path.  This triggers\nwhen the user reads from /dev/hwrng into memory also mmap-ed from\n/dev/hwrng.  The resulting page fault triggers a recursive read\nwhich then dead-locks.\n\nFix this by using a stack buffer when calling copy_to_user.",
