            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nqede: confirm skb is allocated before using\n\nqede_build_skb() assumes build_skb() always works and goes straight\nto skb_reserve(). However, build_skb() can fail under memory pressure.\nThis results in a kernel panic because the skb to reserve is NULL.\n\nAdd a check in case build_skb() failed to allocate and return NULL.\n\nThe NULL return is handled correctly in callers to qede_build_skb().",
