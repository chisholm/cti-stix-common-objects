The problem was in\nmissing validation check.\n\nhdw->unit_number is initialized with -1 and then if init table walk fails\nthis value remains unchanged. Since code blindly uses this member for\narray indexing adding sanity check is the easiest fix for that.\n\nhdw->workpoll initialization moved upper to prevent warning in\n__flush_work.",
