            "description": "Certain DNSSEC aspects of the DNS protocol (in RFC 4035 and related RFCs) allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via one or more DNSSEC responses when there is a zone with many DNSKEY and RRSIG records, aka the \"KeyTrap\" issue. The protocol specification implies that an algorithm must evaluate all combinations of DNSKEY and RRSIG records.",
