            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nocteontx2-af: Fix a memleak bug in rvu_mbox_init()\n\nIn rvu_mbox_init(), mbox_regions is not freed or passed out\nunder the switch-default region, which could lead to a memory leak.\n\nFix this bug by changing 'return err' to 'goto free_regions'.\n\nThis bug was found by a static analyzer. The analysis employs\ndifferential checking to identify inconsistent security operations\n(e.g., checks or kfrees) between two code paths and confirms that the\ninconsistent operations are not recovered in the current function or\nthe callers, so they constitute bugs.\n\nNote that, as a bug found by static analysis, it can be a false\npositive or hard to trigger. Multiple researchers have cross-reviewed\nthe bug.\n\nBuilds with CONFIG_OCTEONTX2_AF=y show no new warnings,\nand our static analyzer no longer warns about this code.",
