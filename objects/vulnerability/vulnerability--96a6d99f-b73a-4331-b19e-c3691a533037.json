            "description": "Adobe Commerce versions 2.4.7-beta1, 2.4.7-p3, 2.4.6-p8, 2.4.5-p10, 2.4.4-p11 and earlier are affected by a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability that could be abused by a low-privileged attacker to inject malicious scripts into vulnerable form fields. Malicious JavaScript may be executed in a victimâ€™s browser when they browse to the page containing the vulnerable field. A successful attacker can abuse this to achieve session takeover, increasing the confidentiality and integrity impact as high.",
