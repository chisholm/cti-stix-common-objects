[.stix-doc-information-heading]*Abstract:*

The current STIX 2.1 standard does not provide a way to share generic human readable strings that have been discovered as part of CTI or malware analysis work.  While it is possible to share information such as filenames, urls and passwords for specific user accounts.  It is not possible to indicate that a particular string is used as part of the unpacker process for a piece of malware nor that a piece of malware is packaged with a unique identifier for a campaign.

This extension creates a new SCO to support this kind of information capture and sharing.  Observed strings allow for the sharing of simple string information and a high-level understanding of the purpose the string serves.


== 1. Observed Strings in STIX

Observed strings are an SCO that tracks both the value and purpose of a string that was discovered through malware analysis, threat hunting, or other analysis activities.  These can be used to track things like common decryption keys, mission IDs embedded within malware, named pipes, user-agent strings and much more.

[[observed-string]]
== 2. Observed String SCO

The properties and additional types within the Observed String Extension are defined below. This extension *MUST* use [stixliteral]#extension-definition--8b1aa84c-5532-4c69-a8e7-b6170facfd3d# as its extension ID.

There is only one property within this extension section "extension_type" with a value of new-sco.
